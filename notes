push is append and unshift is insert 

the push method adds an element to the ends of the array. 
as the array size array size gets samller so dose the 
runtime. the unshift method adds an elemnent to the 
begining of an array and similarly to the push method
the run time decreases as the array size get smaller.
comparativly the runtime for the push method runs faster
then the unshiftmethod but as the array size decreases
the gap between the runtimes become closer until
the unshift method runtime is less then the push method
so in conclusion the unshift scales better then the push.
